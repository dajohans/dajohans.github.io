# David Johansson

Doctoral student at University of Jyväskylä

I work on inverse problems for partial differential equations, in the deterministic setting and focusing on uniqueness issues. I am also interested in stochastic PDEs and Bayesian inverse problems, but currently don't work on that. I am not a numerical analyst but I like to implement proof of concept inversion algorithms(usually optimization based) for the inverse problems I study.

I also have a background in computer science and have some interests like compiler construction, programming language design and algorithms for discrete optimization. This is not something I do for work, but in particular discrete optimization is something I could see myself trying to get back into in the future.

I'm also a bit of an Emacs and Vim enthusiast and I wish I was disciplined enough to do more programming in my spare time.
