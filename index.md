# David Johansson

Doctoral student at University of Jyväskylä

My work is on inverse problems for partial differential equations.

I also have a background in computer science and have some interests like compiler construction, programming language design and algorithms for discrete optimization. This is not something I do for work, but in particular discrete optimization is something I could see myself trying to get back into in the future. I'm also a bit of an Emacs and Vim enthusiast and I wish I was disciplined enough to do more programming in my spare time.
